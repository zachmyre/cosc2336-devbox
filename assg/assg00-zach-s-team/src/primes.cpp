/** @brief Is value prime
 *
 * Determine if a given (positive) integer value >= 1 is prime.
 * Prime numbers are numbers that are divisible only by 1 and
 * themselves.  Thus in this implementation, we use a brute force
 * method and test to see if any number from 2 up to the value-1 is
 * a divisor of the number.  If we find such a divisor, then the
 * number is not prime.  If we fail to find such a divisor, then the
 * number is prime.
 *
 * @param value The value to be tested to see if prime or not.
 *
 * @returns bool Returns true if the value is prime, false if it
 *   is not.

/** @brief Find primes in range
 *
 * Find primes in a range of values from start to end (inclusive).
 * This function returns a count of the number of primes found within
 * the range.  As a side effect, the primes that are found in the range
 * are displayed on standard output.
 *
 * @param start The start of the range to search.  This value is inclusive,
 *   we test the start value of the range to see if it is a prime or not.
 * @param end The end of the range to search.  This value is inclusive,
 *   we test the end value of the range to see if it is a prime or not.
 * @param displayOnCout A parameter controlling whether or not primes found
 *   in the range are displayed on the standard cout stream or not.  This
 *   parameter defaults to true, found primes will be displayed when found.
 *
 * @returns int Returns the count of the number of primes we find in the
 *   asked for range.
